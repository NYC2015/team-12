Play any Youtube video as background of your page or as custom player inside an element of the page.

== Description ==

A Chrome-less Youtube速 video player that let you play any YouTube速 video as background of your WordPress速 page or post.
You can activate it for your home page from the settings panel or on any post or page using the short code as described in the Reference section of the settings.

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTW937ld02Y]

**From version 1.0 the player is using the Youtube速 iframe API displaying the video using the HTML5 VIDEO tag for all the browsers that support it.**

**From version 1.7.6 the plug in is internationalized; available in English, Italian and Spanish (thanks to Andrew Kurtis http://www.webhostinghub.com ).**


The mb.YTPlayer doesn't work on any mobile devices (iOs, Android, Windows, etc.) due to restrictions applied by the vendors on media controls via javascript.
Adding a background image to the body as mobile devices fallback is a good practice and it will also prevent unwanted white flickering on desktop browsers when the video is buffering.



note:
If you doesn't want ADs on your background video and you are the owner of it you can disable this on your Youtube channel as explained here: http://candidio.com/blog/how-to-remove-ads-from-your-youtube-videos .

== What about mobile ==

The mb.YTPlayer doesn't work on any mobile devices (iOs, Android, Windows, etc.) due to restrictions applied by the vendors on media controls via javascript.
Adding a background image to the body as mobile devices fallback is a good practice and it will also prevent unwanted white flickering on desktop browsers when the video is buffering.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm using the plug in as background video and I can see the control bar on the bottom but the video doesn't display =
 Your theme is probably using a wrapper for the content and it probably has a background color or image. You should check the CSS and remove that background to let the video that is behind do display correctly.

= Everything is working fine on my desktop but it doesn't work on any mobile devices =
Due to restrictions adopted by browser vendors and Youtube team this plugin can't work on touch devices.

= I would have an image on the background before the video starts and after the video end; how can I do? =
The simplest way is to add an image as background of the body via CSS.

= I set the video quality to hd1080 but it doesn't display at this quality; why? =
The video quality option is just a suggestion for the Youtube API; the video is served by Youtube with the quality that best fits the bandwidth and the display size according to that setting.

= The video stops some seconds before the real end; why? =
To prevent the display of the "play" button provided by the Youtube API the video intentionally stops some seconds before the end; if you are the owner of the video I can suggest to make it a little bit longer (about 3/4 seconds).
